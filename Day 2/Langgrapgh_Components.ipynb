        "\n",
        ">LangGraph is an orchestration framework for building intelligent, stateful, and multi-step LLM workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "It enables advanced features like parallelism, loops, branching, memory, and resumability — making it ideal for agentic and production-grade AI applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "It models your logic as a graph of nodes (tasks) and edges (routing) instead of a linear chain.\n",
